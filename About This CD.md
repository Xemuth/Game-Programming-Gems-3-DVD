About This CD-ROM
Dear Reader,

Welcome to the Game Programming Gems 3 CD-ROM! Included in this CD-ROM you will find a wide variety of useful information that accompanies the content of the book designed to make your life easier as a game developer. Here are the items included:

Source code listed in the book
Demos of many techniques described in the book
The DirectX8.1 Full SDK (see DirectX developer's page)
The GLSetup Monolithic Public Beta v1.0.0.121
The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT).
High-resolution versions of the color plates
Many of the techniques described in the book are valuable on the many platforms and environments that exist. However, several are very specific to certain environments (e.g., Visual Studio, DirextX8, etc.), and specific hardware (e.g., Nvidia's GeForce3). For your convenience, we have included the DirectX8.1 Full SDK as well as OpenGL drivers, and utility toolkit (GLUT).
